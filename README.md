## About The Project

![home](/images/home.png)

Social Coding Experience was built to make interaction between developers easy.

Here are the features we have implemented in our website

- **Search:**
  Using the search, a user can search for any registered profile and view their stats and also follow them.

- **LeaderBoard:**
  The Leaderboard shows the top 10 performers on the site which is based on our official ranking system that's actually checking the average of leetcode and codechef performance for the particular user.

- **DashBoard:**
  The dashboard displays the stats of the logged in user, which contains github, leetcode and codechef stats.

- **Follow:**
  The logged in user can see whom he/she is following and who is following them not only that but they can also remove their followers and there is a check wether user want other follower to his/her following list or not.

- **Groups:**
  In the groups tab, people can create and join mutiple groups and build a community where they interact and chat with one another.

## Built using

- Below are the technologies we have used to build our project.

- For Frontend we went with REACTJS, which is a component based library and focuses a lot on resuability of the code.

- For Backend we went NODEJS, which enabled the same developers to easily work on both the frontend and backend.

- For Database we went with mongoDB, which is a no-sql database, which provided us with flexibility in our schema as we were building the project.

- We have also deployed out app on Netlify(Frontend) and Heroku(Backend)
